# CIS3296 Project Proposal Presentation
##### Name: Wayne Zheng
## Project Description
* Project name and the author: Project-16x16 / Stephcraft
* Project's GitHub link: https://github.com/Stephcraft/Project-16x16
* Breif summary of the project: Project 16x16 is a **2D platformer game** made with **Java** and **Processing** (Processing is an open-source low-level animation and GUI library built on Java). 
It is an open-source project looking for people to make some awesome contributions. You can contribute not only through coding the game, but also provide gameplay mechanics, original story concepts, 
level designing, and creating soundtracks. The goal of the project is to create an amazing video game with processing. 
Speaking of the game itself, the players control their little character, and they need to solve puzzles and defeat enemies in the game to advance the level.

## Proposed Contribution
* Create more reuseable in-game objects, mainly new traps and switches. This allows other developers to use them in their level design.

* Revise the main user menu.
* Design a story mode (this includes new character designs and new levels).

#### For people who are interested to contribute
* Some background about Java and Processing.
* Passionate about game design.
* IDEs, the author recommended using Eclipse, but I was able to run it perfectly fine on IntelliJ.
#### A few issues you may run into when trying to compile the project locally
* Need to install "javafx" and "processing" packages.
* Configure your "project structure" correctly, may need to use Java SE 8.
