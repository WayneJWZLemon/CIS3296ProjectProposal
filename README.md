# Project-16x16
## Project Abstract
Project 16x16 is a 2D platformer game made with **Java** and **processing** (processing is an open-source low-level animation and GUI library built on Java). It is an open-source project looking for people to make some awesome contributions. You can contribute not only through coding the game, but also provide gameplay mechanics, original story concepts, level designing, and creating soundtracks. The goal of the project is to create an amazing video game with processing. Speaking of the game itself, the players control their little character, and they need to solve puzzles and defeat enemies in the game to advance the level. As someone who is looking forward to contributing, the authors recommend you to have some background about Java and processing.
## Project Relevance
This project clearly has a **graphical user interface**. It contains many components such the client and server interaction, story scene, camera, audio, and other in-game objects, all of which are implemented with **object-oriented design**. There is a corresponding testing folder you can find in the repository, so it does have some elements of **test-driven development**. Also, there is a well-detailed markdown file in the repository that describes how to contribute to the project using git, GitHub Desktop, and source tree, which means the project is suitable for tasks like **project management**, **version control**, and **issue tracking**. The underlying points above are sufficient to make this project a desirable teamwork application for the CIS 3296 class. These educational goals are important to discuss and to put into practice because modern software design is a team activity, and it comprises the full life cycle of design, testing, and maintenance. The skills and design patterns mentioned above allow us to create a more versatile software product efficiently.
## Conceptual Design
Create new in-game objects like traps and switches that enable the in-game characters controlled by the players to have more and different interactions with each other. In the current project repository on GitHub, there is a folder contains Java classes such as “EditableObject,” “CollidableObject,” “BackgroundObject,” etc. This means that we can either inherit from the existing classes or start creating from the scratch. Since the project is completely open-source, creating more traps and switches would allow more creative developers to come up with new ideas when building the game map in their new level design. Also, as a team of contributors, we can add more features to the current user main menu, or maybe redesign the menu. Currently, there is no story mode in the game, perhaps we can start laying out a series of game levels that incorporate the new trap and switch objects that we are going to design. These potential contributions involve following the object-oriented development which fulfills the requirement of our assignment. Furthermore, when designing new levels, we need to run the game on our end to test and modify the program to ensure the gaming performance is smooth enough for the clients to play the game on their devices. In this process, we are essentially following the on-the-fly programming style. To make these contributions, we need to draw out new level blueprints and UML diagrams that illustrate the kinds of objects that will involve in the interaction, such as the player characters, the switches, and the traps.

## Compiling Locally and Potential Issues 
#### [Project's Github Repo by Stephcraft](https://github.com/Stephcraft/Project-16x16)
#### For people who are interested to contribute
* Some background about Java and Processing.
* Passionate about game design.
* IDEs, the author recommended using Eclipse, but I was able to run it perfectly fine on IntelliJ.
* Clone the repo locally to your machine, you should open up the project folder using IntelliJ, and then use the search feature within IntelliJ to locate the main function to start the program.
#### A few issues you may run into when trying to compile the project locally
* Need to install "JavaFX" and "Processing" packages.
* Configure your "project structure" correctly, may need to use Java SE 8.
* Link to download JavaFX: https://openjfx.io/
* Link to download Processing: https://processing.org/
